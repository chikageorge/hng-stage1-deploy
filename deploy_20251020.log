Pending kernel upgrade
----------------------

Newer kernel available

The currently running kernel version is 6.14.0-1011-aws which is not the 
expected kernel version 6.14.0-1014-aws.

Restarting the system to load the new kernel will not be handled automatically, 
so you should consider rebooting.


No containers need to be restarted.

No user sessions are running outdated binaries.
